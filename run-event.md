# How to run a Jep'dy event?

It's easy.  

## Ingredients 

A screen that the audience and the participants can see (which is connected to the computer running the game)
A buzzer for each team or equivilent (we've had great sucess with https://www.multibuzz.app/ )
Ideally a microphone or two.  At least one for the host but one per team is better. 

A space to play.  Can be a seperate room or part of a party or open area.  

## Some cooks

Someone to run the computer side 
Someone to be 'host' to read out the questions,  adjudicate and just be loud and funny.  
Maybe someone to run the buzzer system if using the app

## Some players

How many teams, how many people per team is completely flexible.  We've run 2 teams to 12 and from 3 to 8 people per team.
It;s all a matter of space, available AV,  how long you want to run the game for. 

## An audience 

It's not fun without the audience.  The Host's job is to engage the audience, ask them their views, maybe adjudicate where things are uncertain.

## Prizes

So far we've been lucky and some group or company has come forward and offered prizes for the winning team members.  However it doesn't have to be anything expensive. This is all for fun.
